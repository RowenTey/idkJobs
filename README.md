*A web app that allows university students or fresh graduates to get information about their ideal job.*

## üß™ Tech

This website is fully coded with Python, utilising the `Streamlit` module to structure our web app.  

The `webbrowser` module was also used to allow displaying of web-based documents to users.

## ‚ùì Assignment

*Problem Statement*: University students often find applying for their first job/internships daunting, as it is very troublesome for them to gather relevant information about the job.

*Our Solution*: We create an online platform that helps students source and collect the latest information on various jobs. For instance, you can find information on the salary, popular interview questions, pre-requisites of the job/skills that required before applying for the job with only one click on our web app.

## ‚öô How To Use
First, open the **navigation bar** on the left side.  
Next, choose the role you are looking for and wait for a second, a brief information about the job will appear on the page.  
Additionally, you can specifically select an area you want to know such as **Interview Do's and Dont's**.  
Hooray! You get all the information about your ideal job with just one click!
